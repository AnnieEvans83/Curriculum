AutoAuto Curriculum
=================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction
----------------------------

Our team is building scalable learning platforms that allow kids to start
programming from an early age, gradually leveling them up to more advanced
coding methods and languages.

Our unique curriculum integrates Python programing and hand-held autonomous
cars. The cars provide an engaging way for kids to practice programming and
learn basic machine learning concepts that are essential building blocks
for data science and learning about how autonomous vehicles actually work.

### Curriculum

The AutoAuto curriculum currently is designed for Workshops, Hackathons,
Afterschool programs and Summer schools. In the near feature we will add
an extend version of the curriculum for regular schools. We suggest at most
two students per AutoAuto car.

## Software Needed

An AutoAuto car should be enough. But if you __don't have an AutoAuto car__ and
want to make the jupyter notebooks _run_ (not only view) in a web browser,
