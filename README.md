AutoAuto Curriculum
=================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction
----------------------------

Our team is building scalable learning platforms that allow kids to start
programming from an early age, gradually leveling them up to more advanced
coding methods and languages.

Our unique curriculum integrates Python programing and hand-held autonomous
cars. The cars provide an engaging way for kids to practice programming and
learn basic machine learning concepts that are essential building blocks
for data science and learning about how autonomous vehicles actually work.

### Curriculum

We are currently building a web-based platform for our
curriculum so that students, teachers, and parents can conveniently access new projects as needed.

Our curriculum is currently designed for workshops, hackathons, after-school programs, and day-camps. We will soon have a regular school curriculum and DIY
lessons for students to work on personal projects at home with parents.

The AutoAuto curriculum focuses on the underlying
technologies and systems that would allow an autonomous vehicle to navigate its environment and drive itself. In addition to covering a wide-range of STEM topics - including mathematics, physics, circuitry, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.
